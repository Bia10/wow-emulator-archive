Bring me one of his fangs and I will reward you.  Vagash lurks just above the ranch here, but be warned, he is deadly.

[quest 7065]
name=Corruption of Earth and Seed
desc=Slay Princess Theradras and return to Keeper Marandis at Nijel's Point in Desolace.
details=In the depths of Maraudon lives a creature of chaos and evil, $N. Princess Theradras is an elemental force of earth related somehow to the Old Gods. Ages ago, she was sought out by Zaetar, first son of Cenarius. The offspring of their... relationship are the creatures known as centaur. Ever-thankful creatures, the centaur killed Zaetar, and now Theradras keeps his remains. My quest here is to find those powerful enough to slay Theradras so we may recover Zaetar's remains before returning to Stonetalon.

name=The Pariah's Instructions
desc=Read the Pariah's Instructions. Afterwards, obtain the Amulet of Union from Maraudon and return it to the Centaur Pariah in southern Desolace.
details=Though exiled as a heretic, my beliefs still ring true--that alone drives me onward. But for my destiny to be complete, I need the aid of an outsider... one not of any centaur tribe.$B$BThe task requires someone to enter the holy halls of Maraudon--a tomb my people protect, and only the most devout are ever allowed to enter.$B$BIf you agree to aid me, then you need only nod. I will pass you a parchment with my instructions on it. Read it over and consider my words.

[quest 7070]
name=Shadowshard Fragments
desc=Collect 10 Shadowshard Fragments from Maraudon and return them to Archmage Tervosh in Theramore on the coast of Dustwallow Marsh.
details=I've recently begun testing various crystals and their arcane properties. Lady Proudmoore has given me leave to ask travelers heading into Desolace to seek out a place called Maraudon. Within the ruined temple are great elementals compsed of purplish stones I've named shadowshards.$B$BIf you decide to head that direction and find some of the crystals, I would be very thankful. I could even fashion you a trinket from them if you so desired.
