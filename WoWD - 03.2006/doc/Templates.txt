item info will be stored in spells templates

It has been decided that the templates will be stored in columns as this will allow easy adjustments between verions.
We will load these columns from the table and just change guid and set the creatures x y z o mapid zoneid and save it to the Creatures table.

So what is this?

It's Templates.
basicly a copy of a unit with out unique stuff so you can do ".spawn nameid" and it'll make a unit exacly like you defined
and change the unique things to make it it's own unit, with templates they will be spawned with right displayid, dmg etc
and right weapons equipted.

I will also make it so you can update a template and type a command and all units with the same template will be updated.
I will also make a column in the creatures table that is a bool either use template or don't use it.
