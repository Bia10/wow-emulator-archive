Add things here that need to be changed, added, or thought about later.
This to work on:

  1) Make a list of player/unit flags

  2) Make items work again

  3) Fix spirit healer

  4) Complete spell rewrite

  5) Start Character/Unit rewrite

  6) Look and integrate/reimplement FOOK FvF patches

  7) Complete object manager rewrite

  8) Fix AI to properly handle multiple targets

  9) Deathworld


- Add:
  * Generic error trapping, recovering from, reporting, and logging.

  * Borland support

  * Scripting


- Change:
  * Server should be split to be potentially built with separate
    servers in separate binaries, communicating with each other over
    tcp/ip.

  * Network protocol should be separated from world server
    functionality.  E.g. getgold(39) as opposed to  crafting a
    packet whenever one needs to add gold.

  * Dev-cpp project should be altered to use the dev-cpp mysql
    package (now that there is one) instead of the handbuilt import
    lib.


- Fix:
  * Bug tracker needs some cleaning out. Smash a bug, earn a feature.


- Thoughts and Concerns:
  * Code could use some spring cleaning.  Doxygon output, or
    anything similar, could make life easier for people new to the
    source.  It would be nice to establish and apply some style
    standards to things such as variable naming.

  * Code could use some optimization.  Would it be worth it to
    build in a profiler and some kind of automatic bottleneck
    logging?  At some point we could use a review of all the code
    concerning efficiency, consistency, and expandability.

  * How many threads should we have?  Would it make sense to
    have a separate "functionality" thread from one which
    handles networking and packet queuing? (imo, Yes) If multiple
    servers are built into the same binary they should probably
    only use one networking thread.

  * This could be a lot of work just for a bit of organization,
    but all the pieces of the code are communicating with each
    other like an old peer to peer network protocol.  Should
    appropriate things be centralized around some "core" object?
