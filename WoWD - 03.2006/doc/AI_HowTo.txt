How to add Spells to Creatures?

Add a new line to ai_agents table which has the following fields

entryId should be clear

AI_AGENT is one of this enum where AGENT_MELEE is 1, AGENT_RANGED is 2 and so on:
enum AI_Agent
{
    AGENT_NULL,
    AGENT_MELEE,
    AGENT_RANGED,
    AGENT_FLEE,
    AGENT_SPELL,
    AGENT_CALLFORHELP
};

procEvent is the event which can trigger this spell.
currently we got this enum with events where EVENT_ENTERCOMBAT is 0(not all are used yet cause our combat system doesnt support a few of it):
enum AiEvents
{
    EVENT_ENTERCOMBAT,
    EVENT_LEAVECOMBAT,
    EVENT_DAMAGETAKEN,
    EVENT_TARGETCASTSPELL,
    EVENT_TARGETPARRYED,
    EVENT_TARGETDODGED,
    EVENT_TARGETBLOCKED,
    EVENT_TARGETCRITHIT,
    EVENT_TARGETDIED,
    EVENT_UNITPARRYED,
    EVENT_UNITDODGED,
    EVENT_UNITBLOCKED,
    EVENT_UNITCRITHIT,
    EVENT_UNITDIED,
    EVENT_ASSISTTARGETDIED,
    EVENT_FOLLOWOWNER
};

procChance is the Chance to cast that spell.
e.g. 50 for a 50% chance to cast that spell in the event

procCount is how often that spell should be used in one Fight. 0 means infinite use

spellId is the spellId of the spell to cast

spellType is one of that enum:
enum AI_SpellType
{
    STYPE_NULL,
    STYPE_ROOT,
    STYPE_HEAL,
    STYPE_STUN,
    STYPE_FEAR,
    STYPE_SILENCE,
    STYPE_CURSE,
    STYPE_AOEDAMAGE,
    STYPE_DAMAGE,
    STYPE_SUMMON,
    STYPE_BUFF,
    STYPE_DEBUFF
};

spelltargetType is one of that enum:
enum AI_SpellTargetType
{
    TTYPE_NULL,
    TTYPE_SINGLETARGET,
    TTYPE_DESTINATION,
    TTYPE_SOURCE
};

spellCooldown is the cooldown for that spell after it got casted

floatMisc1 and Misc2 are misc values which are used for a few spell types:
example:
STYPE_HEAL
floatMisc1 defines the hp percentage at which it should cast that spell.


lets say you got 20% chance to cast a healing spell at EVENT_DAMAGETAKEN.
with floatMisc1 is 0.40.

Creature has a 20% chance to cast that healing spell when damage taken and hp of it or one of its assistTargets is <=40%
