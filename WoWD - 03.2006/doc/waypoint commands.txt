*NOTES
yes = 1, no = 0 
Backwards is a boolean, is it a backwards action
1  -> -> -> 10 = Forwards
10 -> -> -> 1  = Backwards 

oneshot is to do the emote once
any thing with multiple arguments requires the argument before it
	eg .waypoint emote 1 100 0 	- sets backwards emote to 100 and does it multiple times
	eg .waypoint emote 0 50 1	- sets forward emote to 50 and does it once
	eg .waypoint emote 0 50		- sets forward emote to 50 and does it once
	eg .waypoint emote 0 		- sets forward emote to 0 and does it once
	eg .waypoint emote 		- sets forward emote to 0 and does it once

skinid of 0 is default skin
emotes are done when arriving at the waypoint
skins are changed when leaving previous waypoint and traveling to the current waypoint
