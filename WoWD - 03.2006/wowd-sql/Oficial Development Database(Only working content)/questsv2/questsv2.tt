But we've learned that the material from which these bandanas are made signifies the member's rank.$b$bThat being said, I want you to eliminate as many high ranking Defias members as you can.  The highest ranking members will undoubtedly be found in VanCleef's secret hideout.  When you're done bring me 10 Red Silk Bandanas as proof of their deaths and I will reward you.  Good luck, $N.

You saw here what I had thought would be my chance to infiltrate Kurzen's Compound.  I was wrong, and again, thanks for saving me.$B$BThis was a top secret mission, so you must tell no one.  But if you speak with Doren he will explain.
sCompleteText = Yes, what Thorsen told you is true. You must be discrete with this. At one time, we rebels were fiercely loyal to Colonel Kurzen. But such was Kurzen's corruption, our passion twisted into rage.  If it was made known that Private Thorsen has had recent dealings with Kurzen's men, then one night he would find himself with a slit throat.$b$bTo my knowledge, only Sergeant Yohwa, Thorsen and I were privy to Thorsen's mission. But there must be another. A traitor.

sCompleteText = To be in the presence of the Oracle Tree... it is almost to feel wisdom take form. Let me continue the telling...$b$bWith Teldrassil grown, the Arch $C approached the dragons for their blessings, as the dragons had placed upon Nordrassil in ancient times. But Nozdormu, Lord of Time, refused to give his blessing, chiding the $C for his arrogance. In agreement with Nozdormu, Alexstrasza also refused Staghelm, and without her blessing, Teldrassil's growth has been flawed and unpredictable...
sIncompleteText = Along with the druids, the Oracle Tree and the Arch $C have been carefully monitoring the growth of Teldrassil. But though we have a new home, our immortal lives have not been restored.

Go with friends to the Roguefeather Den west of Freewind Post. Make your way to the depths of their lair and destroy their foodstuffs. By then you should have provoked their fury, and if you are able to survive long enough, Grenka Bloodscreech herself will come for you--kill her and bring me her claw to complete your test.

And be careful, $N, the night elves may wish to impede your test.
sCompleteText = The days and nights grow colder throughout the world as goblins rape the land, and the night elves point fingers at the younger races. The Forsaken and orcs are not the only ones to blame for the hardships found throughout Kalimdor and Lordaeron. Many of the intelligent races have contributed to the world's pain. Dorn knows this, and he has sent you to me because you have shown the attributes necessary to realize it also.$b$bNow you stand before Braug.

Besides ogres, orcs and murlocs, the southern part of the swamp is filled with black dragons.

He doesn't really care that we're short-handed as is.$B$BThe first few items on his list should be easy enough to get, and it'd be a good chunk of coin for anyone helping me out.$B$BI need some horns and claws from the Hatefury satyr to the east of here. Bring 'em back to me and we'll get started on the rest of the list.

The Atal'ai Haze can be collected from the deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes found there. Good luck, $N!

How this creature came to be here is unknown; the group of murlocs that now feast off the carcass of it seem to be much too weak, even in large numbers, to have brought down the beast. $B$BWhile some of it has been picked clean, enough of it remains to take a sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine to study.

The worg of Blackrock come from Halycon and her mate. Halycon is the gigantic den mother of the worg. Her mate? Nobody has ever lived to tell the tale of that one.$B$BStrike at the heart of the worg.

Her relationship with the spirits of water has always been strong. Our task being a noble one should be enough to persuade her and the spirits of water to aid us in this task.$B$BYou should find her at a small camp right along the water's edge.

Apothecary Dithers will have more information on that, so be sure to speak with him as soon as possible.

There is only one sort device I am aware of that could possibly contain something as vile as the Felvine: a Reliquary of Purity.$B$BDeep in the wasteland of Silithus is the remnants of the night elf village known as Southwind.

The leaders of the Searing Blade.$b$bI knew the Shadow Council sought to take Orgrimmar and all of the Horde from me, but I hadn't realized how quickly they were able to infiltrate the city. So many arms this beast has... we can cut them off until exhaustion sets in, but we will be no further than when we started. I will have to have my spies double their efforts.

One, you may be able to gain some greater knowledge about the Council or at least the Burning Blade, and two, he may just begin to trust you enough that he asks you to start to aid him. He may very well look at you as someone who can fill the void now that some of the leadership is in turmoil.$B$BReturn to the Cleft and speak to him again, but do not be too overt.

In sending travelers into Ragefire Chasm, I should have seen the possibility that some harm would come from it. It seems both Bazzalan and Jergosh were taken unaware and slain by some of Thrall's do-gooders. A most inopportune time, but there is nothing that can be done about it now.

sDetails = Gifts, treats, presents... bah, I say!$B$BThose goblins pollute the true meaning of this season - the Feast of Winter Veil.  This is a time of renewal; the land slumbers under a blanket of snow brought forth by Greatfather Winter, who is NOT the bumbling fool over there in the red suit!$B$BIf you're interested in learning what the Feast is all about for yourself, ask Sagorne Creststrider.  I'm sure he'll be surprised that someone cares about history rather than getting presents.
sCompleteText = The Feast of Winter Veil, you say? Alas, in times past it held a more substantial meaning to us $R. Nowadays, it seems as though others have turned the legend of this season of renewal into something that helps to sell candies and presents.$b$bIt's no surprise that Furmund is bitter about that sort of change. He and other tauren like him cling to our past like a banner of war. While I think a little celebration is always good, it is important to remember the origins of the Feast.

sDetails = In surveying the Writhing Deep, one of our scouts reported seeing a giant insect - much larger than the other insects spotted - wandering about the twisted terrain.  Not only is it larger, it also seems to secrete some sort of aura that the other insects don't.  We've given it a name - Stinglasher.$B$BThe innards of this beast would be invaluable to study as we figure out the best way to deal with this new threat.  Cut out its secretion glands and bring it back to me immediately!

sDetails = Archmage Xylem has been asking around lately... for someone of your experience.$b$bIf you wish to seek him out, you can find him in Azshara.  His tower is built high atop the cliffs, and the only way up is a teleport spell invoked by his arrogant servant, Sanath Lim-yo.$b$bSanath makes camp below his master's tower.  To find him, travel to where Azshara's main road forks at the entrance to the Ruins of Eldarath.  From that spot, head directly north until you reach the cliffs.
