' TITLE:
' Secure Hash Algorithm, SHA-1

' AUTHORS:
' Adapted by Iain Buchan from Visual Basic code posted at Planet-Source-Code by Peter Girard

' PURPOSE:
' Creating a secure identifier from person-identifiable data

' The function SecureHash generates a 160-bit (20-hex-digit) message digest for a given message (String).
' It is computationally infeasable to recover the message from the digest.
' The digest is unique to the message within the realms of practical probability.
' The only way to find the source message for a digest is by hashing all possible messages and comparison of their digests.
