Spirit 
Increases health and mana regeneration. Spirit affects all characters' mana and
hit point regeneration rates in and out of combat.

Proposed formula (not verified): 

mana/sec = 7 + Spirit/10 (UPDATE: see Health/Mana Regen for more specific rates)

Also, sitting down does not speed up mana (or health) regeneration, only
drinking (respective eating) does that.


Quote:  
Spirit increases the rate of health and mana regeneration. 

Health regeneration only takes place out of combat. Mana regeneration may take
place in combat, but not for five seconds after completing a spell cast.

The formulas vary across class. Careful investigation is required. 

Sidenote: This comes to confirm my observations. It seems only mana regened for
me when I was fighting (true, since I was a mage and while casting mana never
regened)




Stamina 
Increases health points. Each point of Stamina gives you an additional 10 HP.


Intellect
Increases the rate at which you learn weapon skills. 
Increases your Mana points. 
Increases your chance to score a critical hit with spells.


Attack Power 
- Attack power increases your base melee DPS by 1 for every 14 attack power. 
- Strength increases your melee attack power by 2, except for rogues and
Hunters. Rogues and Hunters gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, and 1 per
point of Agility (see table on page 3 for more detailed calculation).

Warrior Character Level*3+Strength*2-20 
Paladin Character Level*3+Strength*2-20 
Rogue Character Level*2+Strength+Agility-20 
Hunter Character Level*2+Strength+Agility-20 
Shaman Character Level*2+Strength*2-20 
Druid Strength*2-20 
Mage Strength-10 
Priest Strength-10 
Warlock Strength-10 

14 Attack Power = 1 Damage per Second



Defense 
- Increases the chance of being missed by an attack. 
- Increases the chance to dodge, parry, and block. 
- Decreases the chance of being affected by a critical hit. 
- Decreases the chance of being affected by a "crushing blow". Creatures that
are higher level than your character can land crushing blows that deal increased
melee damage. The chance of a crushing blow increases as the level difference
between you and the opposing creature increases. Players never deal "crushing
blows", only creatures.



Agility 

Increases your attack power with ranged weapons. 
Increases your armor. 
Increases your chance to score a critical hit with a weapon. 
Increases your chance to dodge attacks. 
Rogues gain a much stronger bonus to dodge from agility than other classes. 
Hunter & Rogue: Increases your attack power with melee weapons. 

From the Developers: 

Agility 

Increases Armor Class by 2 for every point of AGI. 

Increases the chance of a critical hit with melee and ranged attacks. The amount
of the increase is dependant on both class and level. For most level 60
character classes, approximately 20 points of AGI will increase your critical
hit chance by approximately 1%. Rogues require 29 AGI for an additional 1%
critical hit chance, and Hunters require 53 AGI for an additional 1% critical
hit chance, but both of these classes also gain attack power from agility and
the items available to them typically have much higher amounts of AGI.

Increases the chance to dodge an attack. The amount increased is dependant on
both class and level. For most level 60 character classes, approximately 20
points of AGI will increase your chance to dodge by approximately 1%. Rogues
only require 14.5 AGI for an additional 1% dodge chance. Hunters require 26.5
AGI for an additional 1% dodge chance, but Hunters typically have a high amount
of agility, as well as an Aspect spell that further increases their chance to
dodge attacks.



Strength
Strength increases your melee attack power by 2, except for rogues and Hunters.
Rogues and Hunters gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, and 1 per point of
Agility.

Attack power increases your base melee DPS by 1 for every 14 attack power. 

Increases the amount of damage you can block with a shield. 

Strength does not affect critical hit chances at all. Strength does not improve
your chance to block, but rather the amount of damage blocked when you succeed.
This amount is determined in part by Strength (and the other part by your
shield).





Health regen 

No regeneration in combat. 
There is 1 tick of regeneration every 2 seconds. 
Its value depends on class and spirit : 

Mage = Spirit*0.10 
Priest = Spirit*0.10 
Warlock = Spirit*0.11 
Druid = Unknown 
Shaman = Spirit*0.11 + 9 (from pionere) 
Rogue = Spirit*0.50 
Warrior = Spirit*0.80 
Hunter = Spirit*0.25 
Paladin = Spirit*0.25


Mana regen 

No regeneration while casting (except when specialized in talents that override this) 
Regeneration starts again 5 seconds after casting is over. 
There is 1 tick of regeneration every 2 seconds. 
Its value depends on class and spirit : 

Mage = Spirit/4 + 11 
Priest = Spirit/4 + 13 
Warlock = Spirit/4 + 8 
Druid = Spirit/5 + 15 
Shaman = Spirit/5 + 17 (from pionere) 
Hunter= Spirit/4 + 11 
Paladin = Spirit/4 + 8


Probably outdated with new patches or even then they was not correct  
Shaman: 
Mana += spirit/5 + 17; 
HitPoint += spirit/9 + 9; 

Paladin: 
Mana += spirit/4 + 13;
