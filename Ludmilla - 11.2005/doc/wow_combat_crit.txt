For melee attacks with weapons, the chance to crit is based on agility and
critical strikes deal +100% normal damage (=200%). To see your chance to crit,
open your spellbook, and hover your mouse over the "attack" ability. The tooltip
will show your percent chance to crit.

For spells, the chance to crit is based on intellect. Critical damage spells
deal +50% normal damage (=150%). Critical heals will heal +50% their normal
amount (=150%). There is currently no way to see your chance to crit with
spells.

At level 60, the formula for critical hits is changed as below: 
Spells = [5 + INT/29]% 
Rogue = [5 + AGI/29]% 
Hunter = [5 + AGI/53]% ?? (NOT SURE) 
Warrior/Shaman = [5 + AGI/20]% 
Others = Unknown (most likely same as warrior/shaman) 

The weapon skill affects the chance to crit downwards (-0,04% per point of skill
below the current maximum). As an example, for a maximum weapon skill of 135,
with current weapon skill 112 = -0,92% less chance to cast a critical.

If the target is frozen, the chances to cast a critical hit are increased by 50%. 

The objects increasing crit chance add up. 


Info on crit and hit chances (from devs) 

part 1 

The way WoW calculates crit rate is over ALL attacks. Crit rate is not based on
hits only. In other words, if you have a 5% crit rate, that 5% chance includes
misses. (they're talking here about the in-game crit display tooltip, ignore
this if you don't know what it is)

All crit rate adjusting abilities, items, and talents add the flat % to the base
% crit rate. So if I have a 5% base crit rate and then use an item or talent
that increases that crit rate (let's use Improved Backstab talent for example -
+30% crit), my new crit with backstab is 35%.

Regarding how defense decreases the rate of critical strikes, each point of
defense that a target has over the attacker, the attacker loses 0.04% chance to
crit. So, for example, if a level 60 Rogue is attacking a level 60 Warrior who
has 25 defense, the rogue's crit rate will be decreased by 1%. (I think this
only applies in PvP)

part 2 

+toHit items subtract from your miss%. 

So, ignoring all defensive actions (Block/Parry/Dodge/etc..) if I have 20% crit
chance, 20% miss chance, and 60% hit chance and I equip an item that gives me
+5% toHit and +5% crit, my stats become 25% crit, 15% miss chance, 60% hit
chance.

New hit chance = (Original hit%) + (toHit modifiers) - (crit modifiers) 
60% + 5% - 5% = 60% 

New crit chance = (Original crit%) + (crit modifiers) 
20% + 5% = 25% 

New miss chance - (Original miss%) - (toHit modifiers) 
20% - 5% = 15% 

(seems pretty clear, I assume it generates a random action on strike according
the given probabilities - programmers 'language': random (1 - 10000); IF IN
1-6000 = hit, 6001-8500 = crit, 8501-10000 = miss)
