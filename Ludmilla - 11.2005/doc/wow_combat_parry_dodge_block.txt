Parry, Dodge, Block (high) 

Quote:  
Each point of +Defense skill adds 0.04% to Parry, Dodge, and Block.

This means +25 Defense will grant you an extra 1% Parry, Dodge, and Block. The
formula has been tested to be the same for both Hunters and Paladins. It's
probably constant across all classes. Rogues are most likely to have a differing
formula.

Defense has additional rumored effects: The following four effects of Defense
were supposedly posted by a CM on WoW's European forums. A link to the official
post would be nice.

Increases the chance of being missed by an attack. 

Increases the chance to dodge, parry, and block. 

Decreases the chance of being affected by a critical hit. 

Decreases the chance of being affected by a "crushing blow". Creatures that are
higher level than your character can land crushing blows that deal increased
melee damage. The chance of a crushing blow increases as the level difference
between you and the opposing creature increases. Players never deal "crushing
blows", only creatures

Dodge 

General formula at level 60 = [AGI/14,5 + (Defense*0,04)]%. 
Rogue = [(AGI/(1,15 + AG base/20) - lvl/5 + (Defense*0,04)]%. 

Note : Dodge works also against spells. 


Quote:  
Block 

Block chance doesn't mean fully blocking the damage of that hit, but a partial
absorbtion of a quantity of damage, as follows:

X = [(Shield block value) + (STR/30)]. 

Therefor, the warrior is favored here, because of the natural increased strength. 

Note : Block works also against spells.
