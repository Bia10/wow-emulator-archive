Hunter Functionality (medium) 

Quote:  
Why medium? Huge amount of stuff to implement, that's why. 
I won't compile info this time, it's too much and don't have the time for it
(also I haven't played a hunter yet). Go grab it in the following places:

Hunter Pet Abilities 
Hunter Class 
Hunter Tactics 
Tamed Creatures Statistics 

Pet wasn't tagging the mob, but this was changed in a patch. Your pet actually
DOES tag a mob as yours when it attacks, but you still don't get any experience
when you don't help it, and can't loot it. If you hit at least once, you get
full XP. I think Blusard did this so you couldn't just set your pet to
aggressive, watch a movie, and pick up the loot afterwards.
