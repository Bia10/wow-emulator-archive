XP & tagging system (medium) 

Quote:  


A player does not get XP, nor can he loot a mob aggroed by someone else if he is
not grouped in some way (party, raid etc) with the puller (XP is also not
rewarded if the mob is a number of levels below you... 5 I think)

[sidenote]: the above rules are also determinant for the warlock ability to pull
soulshard from mobs (he can only get a soulshard if he gets XP for that mob)



UPDATE: It was mentioned in a pre-beta note that they MAY be increasing the
range of xp bearing mobs for higher level characters. I believe it will be 20%
of your level with a minimum of 5 levels. We will hopefully have this in the
next patch (beta 1, my note), but no promises.

Examples: 
Level 10 character would get experience from level 6+ mobs 
Level 50 character would get experience from level 40+ mobs

Already stated this, but let's review and detail it a little: 

A player does not get XP, nor can he loot a mob aggroed by someone else if he is
not grouped in some way (party, raid etc) with the puller (XP is also not
rewarded if the mob is a number of levels below you... 20% of your level with a
minimum of 5 levels) ALSO, he doesn't get a kill count for quests, if he is not
in the mob's hate (or aggro/threat) list (this also apply for Honorable Kills in
PVP!), even if his group/raid killed the mob (he does still get money or loot
rights, if it's the case... for XP, I'll have to check, there is a group bonus
and different ratios according to party members' levels).

soulshard from mobs (he can only get a soulshard if he gets XP for that mob)


Mob XP reloaded
Quote:  

XP=(MOB_LEVEL*5+45)*(1+0.05*(MOB_LEVEL-PLAYER_LEVEL)) 

Mob Colors (when pressing the V key in-game) - (the following info is not precise) 
5 levels and above -- Red (XP decreases (or caps?) as difference increases) 
Between +4 and +3 levels -- Orange (XP using above formula) 
Between +2 and -2 levels -- Yellow (XP using above formula) 
Between -3 and 80% of your level -- Green (XP using above formula) 
Below 80% of your level (minimum 5 levels below, you know the story) -- Grey (no XP!!!) 

Also (I've probably already said this) XP awarded depends on the damage you do
to the mob (this means that if a higher level player "helps" you by allowing you
to tag the mob and killing it afterwards, you get only low/no XP. Of course, if
the helper is not grouped with you, he still gets no XP)
