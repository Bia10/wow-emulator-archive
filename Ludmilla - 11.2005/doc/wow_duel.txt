Duels (high) 


Quote:  
At any time in your travels, you may opt to have a 1v1 duel with another player.
You do this by selecting and walking up to him, right click on his portrait and
choose the Duel option or by using the /duel command. A duel flag (gameobject
dropped) will then appear between him and you. If he accepts the duel, the
battle will commence in 5 seconds (with countdown shown on chat); he will turn
hostile and his name will change colour to red. During this time, all combat
rules specific to your server ruleset will apply, such as the spell limitations
of control type spells on the PvP server.

The duel does not end until one of two things occur. When one player's hp is
reduced to 1 or less, the result of the duel is announced to the zone you're in.
No deaths actually occur and the defeated player is simply set to 1 hp. The
loser also kneels before you. The duelling area is a large area of roughly 50
yards centered on the duel flag. If one player leaves the duelling zone for more
than 10 seconds, he is considered to have forfeited the duel. Alternative, a
player may also use /forfeit command. The results of this will also be announced
to other players in the same zone.

There is no penalty for winning or losing a duel except that both parties have
to spend some time after the battle to heal their hp and mana. However, due to
some game bugs, it is still possible to die in a duel such as in the case with
DoT spells

You can't duel in certain areas. 

You can't duel players you can attack normally. 

Skills will not increase from use while dueling or engaged in PvP. 

Dueling players can cast helpful spells on their allies (but not vice versa).
