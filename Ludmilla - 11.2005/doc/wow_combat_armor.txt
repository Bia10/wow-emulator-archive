Armor reduces physical damage done against you by a certain percent. It depends
on the level of the monster (or player) hitting you. Your own level doesn't
matter. By hovering your mouse over Armor on your Character screen, you can see
the value of this reduction for monsters that are at your current level.

This percent reduction will actually fall as soon as you gain a level if you're
still wearing the same armor. You haven't lost anything, it's merely showing you
that your armor isn't as effective against monsters one level higher than you
used to be.

Armor = 2 * AGI + objects armor + shield armor. 

%Reduction = (Armor / (Armor+400 + 85*Enemy_Level))*100 

The maximum damage reduction is capped at 75% of the damage.

Therefor, to determine which must be the AC of your character in order to absorb
the possible maximum of the received damage against an enemy of your lvl or lvl
lower (=75% of the damage he does), the formula is thus the following one:
Armor = 1200 + 255 * lvl. 

Sidenote: This formula is confirmed to be a good aproximation in various
websites. I'd attach the graph, it's a bit more relevant, but your phpBB doesn't
support attachements.
