Whenever you step into an inn or a major city, your level counter is replaced by
zzz's, your player portrait in the top left corner should flash yellow and you
will get the message "You feel rested". Basically, the longer you stay in the
'zzz' mode, the more rested you are. Your xp bar turns blue, and you should see
a little pointer on the xp bar. All fighting experience you acquire up until you
reach that pointer will be doubled. Quest XP doesn't count, so if you complete a
quest, the pointer will go up by the amount received from it, so you can still
get the double xp from fighting. You can log off while parked in an inn and that
pointer just keeps on moving, up to a max of 1.5 levels.

8 hours = 1 bubble rested 
1 level = 20 bubbles 
Max rested is 30 bubbles (1.5 level) = 10 days resting
