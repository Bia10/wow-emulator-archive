Proc is short for "process." This term is used to describe the act of random
effects going off. For example:

"When Silent Fang procs, it silences your target for 6 seconds." 
"Paladins spend fights praying for Seal of Command to proc." 

Procs per hit is simply the percent chance of a proc occurring each hit. This
can be an attack you launch or an attack launched on you. This may seem obvious,
but it's a good term to have in contrast to the less intuitive procs per minute.
Procs per hit benefit greatly from faster hits.

Procs per minute scales procs per hit according to weapon speed. Here's the
formula:

Procs per hit = (Weapon speed) / (60 / Procs per ninute) 

which is the same as: 

Procs per hit = Weapon speed * Procs per minute / 60 

This gives the percentage chance that the proc will go off each hit. An
understandable misconception is that procs per minute guarantees that exactly
some amount of procs will occur each minute of combat. As you can see, this is
not the case. The term is a little misleading.


Example: 

Seal of Command tests out at 5 Procs per minute. Let's say you have an Arcanite
Reaper which has a speed of 3.8 seconds.
3.8 * 5 / 60 = 31.66% chance to proc Command per hit. 

What about a Dimensional Blade which has a speed of 1.6 seconds? 
1.6 * 5 / 60 = 13.33% chance to proc Command per hit.
