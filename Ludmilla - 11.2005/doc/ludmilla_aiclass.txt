Let me try to compile such list... It still will be not full, so get ready to add any updates 
to your generator script and run it over and over again :)

Each class has 3 branches of spells + base spells available to everyone of that race, also 
each class has 3 branches of talents. We will not think about talents this time, because we 
have no knowledge about it, and mobs unlikely to use talents, only spells. As I noticed mobs 
rarely (or never) use spells from all 3 branches, rather from 2. So warrior mob, sundering your armor, 
is unlikely to hit you with battle shout or rend from other spell branches.

If no aispells= specified, defaults to melee

aispells=melee // only melee combat

WARRIOR
aispells=warrior // using some subset of arms + protection?

MAGE
aispells=mage // maybe uses some random branch?
aispells=mage.fire
aispells=mage.frost
aispells=mage.shadow // word "Shadowmage"

PALADIN
aispells=paladin // maybe uses some random branch
aispells=paladin.holy // word "Scarlet"
aispells=paladin.protection // Scarlet boss - Mograine and Whitemane

PRIEST
aispells=priest // uses holy + shadowmagic
// Can't remember priest mobs, maybe some bosses or healing supports in instances...

ROGUE
aispells=rogue // uses subtlety + combat spells

SHAMAN // word "Mystic", "Shaman"
aispells=shaman // elementalcombat + restoration branches I guess

WARLOCK
aispells=warlock // use destruction and affliction branches

DRUID
aispells=druid // uses restoration + balance - healing and entangling roots druid

HUNTER
// Well I don't remember any hunter mob, so this class entirely not used

OTHER AI SPELL SETS
aispells=spider
aispells=dragonkin // fireballs, then flame breath since some high level
aispells=rabid // casts disease or rabies of maximum available level
aispells=shadowhorn // "shadowhorn stag" beast in ashenvale casts curse of shadowhorn

==========================================
NOW TO AI CLASSES

Aiclass can use any one aispells= value to cast in combat. If no aiclass= specified, defaults 

to mixed.

aiclass=none // does not react
aiclass=coward // flees from threat
aiclass=melee // attacks only melee
aiclass=mixed // hits melee, casts spells from aispell= set on enemy or allies or self
aiclass=caster // prefers to cast first, can hit melee
aiclass=purecaster // only casts, never hits melee (warlock imp)

AI ROLES

Ai roles tell what creature does when idle and no threat around. If no AI role specified, then defaults to none.

airole=none // does nothing special
airole=guard // guards territory, chasing and melee attacking all enemies, does not cast
airole=worker // shows work animation, can walk path
airole=smith // shows smithing animation, can walk path
airole=training // attacks combat dummy constantly dealing zero damage
airole=dead // lays like dead or sick, but talks and gives quests
airole=sitting // sits on the ground

// Later to think about savannah lions, that can sleep :)
