Attack Power 

- Attack power increases your base melee DPS by 1 for every 14 attack power. 

- Strength increases your melee attack power by 2, except for rogues and
Hunters. Rogues and Hunters gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, and 1 per
point of Agility (see table on page 3 for more detailed calculation).

Warrior     CharacterLevel*3+Strength*2-20 
Paladin     CharacterLevel*3+Strength*2-20 
Rogue       CharacterLevel*2+Strength+Agility-20 
Hunter      CharacterLevel*2+Strength+Agility-20 
Shaman      CharacterLevel*2+Strength*2-20 
Druid       Strength*2-20 (Warrior formula for Bear Form, Rogue formula for Cat Form) 
Mage        Strength-10 
Priest      Strength-10 
Warlock     Strength-10 

Attack Power (Ranged) = (Level*2 + Agility*2)-20 

14 Attack Power = 1 Damage per Second
