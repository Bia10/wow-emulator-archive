Some of you know, some (wowemu folks) don't. Weapon skill is capped level based:
this means the maximum skill you can reach depends on your level - more
precisely 5 * level. The closer you are to your capped skill the slower the
skill will go up. The level of the mob doesn't effect skill gain and it doesn't
matter if you hit or miss. Intelligence speeds up skill gains, also gain is
based on weapon swings (it's faster to rase skill with fast weapons). Generally
it will take about 1 swing per skill gain when your skill is less than half of
your weapon skill cap. After a while it will slow down and take multiple swings
per skill point and the last 5 points will probably take as long to raise as all
those before it with the last point taking a very long time compared to those
before it.

You can judge how often and how hard you will hit a mob by comparing its level
to your current weapon skill level divided by 5. If your skill is 4 levels or
lower than the mobs level then you are going to miss a lot, get crits rarely and
do less damage when you do hit.

P.S. Side-note, since were talking about capping, for some professions skills
need to be capped in order to be able to purchase the next level (e.g:
leatherworking), but some don't need that (skinning).
