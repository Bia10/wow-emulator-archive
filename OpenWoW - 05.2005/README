More about SCons
================

The SCons build script has a number of options. Run scons --help for a
complete list.

Some helpful build commands:

    $ scons buildtype=release
    $ scons buildtype=debug
    $ scons -k (keep going when a target can't be made)
    $ scons -j2 (allow 2 jobs at once)
    $ scons -c (remove default targets and dependencies)

By default, SCons performs a debug build.

The wsdrealmlist and wsdworldsrv executables are installed to the bin
directory once they have been built. When performing a debug build,
the character 'd' is appended to the name of an executable.
