havner:
- lua makefile
- NetworkInterface delete in pClient destructor (check if there's memleak)
- RealmMap integration in RealmList
- PthreadLock virtual class for UserHashes and after above point for RealmList
- full WS <-> RL communication, notifications, pings, bla bla bla
- review LINA things i commented out to reimplement them
- add log levels to Log class (or even subclasses to show specific messages)
- unify all Log calls for above (including deletion of all printfs and couts)
- clean Main.cpp files (i'll wait for zap with his commit)
- check variables visibilty and add get/set functions (mainly for Srp)
- add some packet creator for RL to avoid this sprintfs, arrays (operator<<)
- fix RL packet logger and make it work both ways maybe(?)
  RL protocol makes it hard to implement, cause no packet size on beginning
- check why LOGON_PROOF with rejection doesn't work on uncracked exe anymore
- s/char*/const char*/ where it should be
cosmetics:
- includes cleaning
- files' headers check
- clean both version.h (i would put them in one file)

robo:
- lua integration - a big topic to discuss, really
- packet forger - packet generation layer, to make game code packet independant

joker:
- Update combat system
- Update emotes
- Implement the rest of chat system (Zone chat, local defense, world defense,
  local trade, guild chat, party chat, raid chat)
- Replace quest system with a scriptable setup
- Implement quadtree system for in range object collection (I'll handle this one)
- Fix autoconf. it currently does not find mysql/openssl ALOT of the time (even on
  std system layouts)
- Restructurize the database. 
- Update a9's for new 1.2.4 fields/lengths
- Implement zlib compression to replace SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT with
  SMSG_COMPRESSED_UPDATE_OBJECT (this should save some bandwidth :)

zap:
- General cleanup
