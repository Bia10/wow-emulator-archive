4/7/2007- formulas are wrong. Health regenerating too fast. Level-up stats get wrong values.
- warlock dies all the time. probably has no health
- duel target gathering fro spells does not target taret pet ..
- gamobjects are invisible
- client crashes if duel is initialized by char who entered second time the game
- still can loot quest items even if not required
- make create packet caching for prototypes when possible
- duel spell target selection should be different
- make a tool to compare packets from different client versions so it will not be required to make it by hand
- get some gamobject a9
- reset go ids to old id so spells will work ..
- item updates can be sent multiple times to client per turn (like on char login containers can be sent up to 4 times). Make a way to send it once only per turn
- hunter crashes when trying to create bag items : char_field 654(humanslot_19),bagslot 62(slot_0)
- remake most of the db since it is for 1.8 it is causeing a lot of client server differences (spell effect values, enchantments ...)
- casted spell does not owerwrite old one
- creatures on hit spell list (frost armor) is not working as should.
- some creatures do not have any energy so they can't cast spells
- some packets that need checking before reenable : handle_CMSG_GROUP_DECLINE,handle_CMSG_GROUP_UNINVITE,handle_CMSG_GROUP_SET_LEADER,handle_CMSG_LOOT_METHOD,handle_CMSG_GROUP_DISBAND,handle_CMSG_GAMEOBJ_USE,handle_CMSG_NPC_TEXT_QUERY,handle_CMSG_GMTICKET_GETTICKET,CMSG_GROUP_CANCEL,SMSG_GROUP_CANCEL,CMSG_GROUP_UNINVITE,SMSG_SPELL_FAILURE,SMSG_SPELL_COOLDOWN,SMSG_MOVE_SET_HOVER
- make a script to fill creature prefered target column for spells in db
- corpse is not removed from map when you logout dead and enter the game again. Retest this because code looks good
- original sends considerably less creature movement packets 2-3 per turn
- quests need to have cast spell for reward teach spell
- firewall is not working
- when created a warior it tryed to cast spell 8026 (he is not supposed to) somewhere is a memory bug and extra bytes a written or read.Problem persisted!
- on char logout delete items, pet, affects and all other dinamic things
- a lot of items are not in db so they are not added to char templates
- map cells should have lists of creature lists based on faction so we can pick out enemy objects faster(for agro)
- on rogues stealth make him walk and not run
- spell 53(backstab) effect 121. Must be behind !
- load and use spell stackability
- on attack, loot, other chars don't see you making any actions
- log more packets for this CMSG_REQUEST_PARTY_MEMBER_STATS. This needs decoding
- make logs wih more then 2 group mamabers and check SMSG_GROUP_LIST again
- when you learn blood rage everybody dissapears near us.WTF ?
- on server crash make it configurable to restart itself
- blizzard spell needs to gather targets each time it is applying effects
- cretures still move wierdly after generated z cords. Original seems to send packet waves
- quest query is using 4 fixed values, make sure we add columns into db and load/use those
- quest templates got richer with 10 unknown values, add to db and investigate (SMSG_QUESTGIVER_QUEST_DETAILS)
- spell id=1462 (best lore) can print out info about creature like health
- figure out a way to know how do talents get the spell list they affect (maybe it's skill line). Then modify code here : SPELL_AURA_ADD_TARGET_TRIGGER
- spell error codes have to remade
- item enchantents are not saved and loaded from db. Do we require this at all ? For spell based enchantments i think so
- for creature query, 3 values are missing (they are present in wdb files) load, those too
- make a packet sending sheduler. Server is sending some packets too fast and they are throttled
- on login spell 836(logineffect) is casted on char
- relamserver character count for realms
- realmserver realm refresh flood control
- realmserver color is yellow instead of green ? why ?
- relamserver bytes off first char from realm name ?
- pet should walk faster then owner to avoid map dissapear bugs
- on spawn pet, send out pet spells too (see log)
- on char lvl-up,lvl-up pet too
- pet has to be saved/ loaded from database
- make some functions for creature behavior : pasive, defensive, agresive
- make creatures that can do more then 1 thing to show gossip menu instead of vedor_list (ex) (trainer that has a quest too)
- pvp
- sumon creauture
- see what is spell_animation 701
- remake factions for chars. Char should have a copy of faction template (structures) and only yet met factions are visible. Once you meet a new faction it is set visible. Agro should be based on this
- check functions to use pointer refrence when using big structures (asm heap push takes longer)
- chars are not removed from map on exit
- dodge, block, crit can not be modified by spells, block will be always 0 ?
- add on respawn script for creatures when using dota version= should morph creature into next defined creature
- add a basic waypoint list to newly spawned creatures so they will not crash server if attacked. Or find another solution :) for standing creatures
- make sure we delete everything on creaure del (sumon would leave trash datain memory ;))
from solfern : http://thottbot.com/?formula=1 - get xp formula, dmg reduction
- unit speed should not be constant and equal to all. Load it from db and use it.
- s=528,ef=38 - removedisease - what is a diseas spell
- on teleport, map position is not correct ? when char near me teleported i still saw him and when i moved closer to new location he disapeared on old and new place :(
- test if hearthstone time is reloaded. if yes then make it dinamic (item id ...)
- for spell cooldowns add item_id too
- original uses different timers for actions (like rush and directly atack)
- reimport maps (they are wrong)
- char does not see negative auras on self :O
- ghost speaks to char with gossip
- client keeps sending set sheated when we fight with hands. We forget to set flags or values ?
- change creature xp revard to not reward whole group instead reward each char agro owner acordingly
- test areatriggers cast spell ability
- on trade/load clear the made_by field for items so no crash would occure
- should add a list of timed event for char (like timed quest, maybe move here spell affects too)
- make/test explore qests
- sell price is based on durability and not is like in client
- sold and bought item instance will not show in inventory. If bought in same slot ?
- make gameobject looting
- make a database integrity checker
	- check trainer spells that do not teach anything (maybe it's not a bug)
	- creatures that have invalid map id
	- creatures that are outside defined map
	- spirit healers that show
	- vendor items that have no template
	- creatures that have no template
	- gameobjects that have no template
	- trainer invalid spells
	- npc text
	- quests
	- quest items are correct

next milestone :
	item requirements
	item update
	loot objects
	gossip
	instances
   items
	show items for creatures
   take care all of those constructors and destructors that were left uninitilised or not destroyed :(
   spell
	EFF_TARGET_CHAIN - remake this
	add pet and duel to friend / enemy list
	treat all spell failed cases (130 OMG)
	treat all spell efect types (117 OMG*2)
   group could be implemented with a static list(for max 5 members not cool to have list)
   if gameobject is static then cache it's create packet data - see corpse
   recheck to see if all base fields are used and inited as should
   implement gossip menus
   implement channel chat system
   implement scripting support
   handle CMSG_JOIN_CHANNEL (should make a chat handler first)
   rest is initilised without knowing how (hehe, copy + paste)
   handle tutorialflags.tutorial flags are always sent as all finished
make sure all inits and deinits are ok (in constructor set next=NULL)
if pet kills the target then we still should receive xp (char as master of pet, fist we need to implement pets)
on item equip check if requirements have been met
make skills have effect
make tallents have effect
at dmg calculation see if has dual vield and add secondary dmg too to total dmg
ranged dmage is not working
268 - amikor a hunter az inventory-bol amo-t rak a char screen-be
26D - amikor ujratolti 2 loves kozt a fegyvert
check creature/item/go limits for template lists when using them
items are always sending createpacket instead of updatepacket. Maybe we should have some updatemasks stored by owner
import item texts
handle item texts
remake inventory change error codes. They show wrong error strings on client side

maybe later
	- somehow replace dinamic alocation of basic_unit_class lists with constant instances (maybe compiler can optimize the code better, instead using 100 refrences)
	- some trained spells require 3 spells before can be teached-maybe we should add 2 more mysql columns and use them
	- on buy item and somebody else bought the item before us,we will get a not_enough_money err instead of not enough item
	- make item stacking like so you can stack items even if there is only 1 slot left
	- original predicts player movement for creature rush

Not known if should be done yet
	dead creatures are aquired from mapmanager. Maybe healing spells require them , and it is a speed deficiency
	maybe we should destroy items as any other objects for clients on exit so no error should occure (prety small chances)
	maybe we should only send spell cooldown if it is not sent already (check this)
	!!!if you say more then 30 minutes(vendor eliminate sold items)at a vendor watching your sold items, and try to by back, you will get a crash because of the bad guid

dream implementations
	create 2 separate mapmanagers. 1 for static no self interact objects : corpse, gos (large cells). 2 : players + creatures (small cell)
	change mysql library to a newer one
	make server clustering
	socket has a nonbuffered mode ? We use liniar programing so this could be used ?
	disabled sendq for sockets. This is teoreticaly very bad. Make some tests and see if realy is that bad
	implement telnet suport for external commands
